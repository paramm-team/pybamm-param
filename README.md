> [!IMPORTANT]
> All the functionality in pybamm-param is now available in [PyBOP](https://github.com/pybop-team/PyBOP), which will be the focus of future development. We recommend new users to use PyBOP instead of pybamm-param.


pybamm-param is a tool to fit [PyBaMM](https://www.pybamm.org) models to experimental data in order to determine the model parameter values. pybamm-param provides helper classes to handle the most common parameterisation problems, and allows the users to easily mix combine cost functions and optimisers to suit their needs. Examples on how to run this package can be found in the [examples folder](./examples)

## üöÄ Installing pybamm-param

### Using pip

The recommended way to install pybamm-param is by installing the latest release from PyPI. This can be done running

```bash
pip install pbparam
```

We strongly recommend using virtual environments, see more detailed instructions below (steps 1 and 2).

### Install from source

Another option is to install from source. This is not recommended, unless you want to make edits to the code.

The first step is to install `virtualenv` in order to create virtual environments

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

The module dependencies are listed in `pyproject.toml`, the dependancies which are non optional which are installed with the package.

The optional dependancies are split into `dev` and `docs`. `dev` are used for testing and linting, `docs` are used for building the sphinx documentation.

#### Linux & MacOS

1. Create a virtual environment (this is strongly recommended to avoid clashes with the dependencies)

    ```bash
    virtualenv --python="<path to python 3.11>" env
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment

    ```bash
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

    The virtual environment can later be deactivated (if needed) by running

    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

3. Install packages into the virtual envronment

    ```bash
    pip install -e ./[dev,docs]
    ```

#### Windows

1. Create a virtual environment (this is strongly recommended to avoid clashes with the dependencies)

    ```bash
    python -m virtualenv env
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment

    ```bash
    env\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```

    The virtual environment can later be deactivated (if needed) by running

    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

3. Install package from Github

    ```bash
    pip install -e .\\[dev,docs]
    ```
